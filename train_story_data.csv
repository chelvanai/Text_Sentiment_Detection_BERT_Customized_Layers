old_bach.emmood,2:2,"Where the name came from, and what it means is very uncertain.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,3:3,"It is said to be German, but that is unjust to the Germans, for it would then be called ""Hauschen,"" not ""Hysken.""",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,4:4,"""Hauschen,"" means a little house; and for many years it consisted only of a few small houses, which were scarcely larger than the wooden booths we see in the market-places at fair time.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,5:5,"They were perhaps a little higher, and had windows; but the panes consisted of horn or bladder-skins, for glass was then too dear to have glazed windows in every house.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,6:6,"This was a long time ago, so long indeed that our grandfathers, and even great-grandfathers, would speak of those days as ""olden times;"" indeed, many centuries have passed since then.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,7:7,"The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck, who carried on trade in Copenhagen, did not reside in the town themselves, but sent their clerks, who dwelt in the wooden booths in the Hauschen street, and sold beer and spices.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,8:8,"The German beer was very good, and there were many sorts- from Bremen, Prussia, and Brunswick- and quantities of all sorts of spices, saffron, aniseed, ginger, and especially pepper; indeed, pepper was almost the chief article sold here; so it happened at last that the German clerks in Denmark got their nickname of ""pepper gentry.""",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,9:9,"It had been made a condition with these clerks that they should not marry; so that those who lived to be old had to take care of themselves, to attend to their own comforts, and even to light their own fires, when they had any to light.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,10:10,"Many of them were very aged; lonely old boys, with strange thoughts and eccentric habits.",N:Sa,N:S
old_bach.emmood,11:11,"From this, all unmarried men, who have attained a certain age, are called, in Denmark, ""pepper gentry;"" and this must be remembered by all those who wish to understand the story.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,12:12,"These ""pepper gentlemen,"" or, as they are called in England, ""old bachelors,"" are often made a butt of ridicule; they are told to put on their nightcaps, draw them over their eyes, and go to sleep.",N:N,N:N

old_bach.emmood,19:19,"Well, we shall hear in the story.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,20:20,"In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and passengers would stumble out of one hole into another, as they generally do in unfrequented highways; and the street was so narrow, and the booths leaning against each other were so close together, that in the summer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one booth to another opposite.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,21:21,"At these times the odor of the pepper, saffron, and ginger became more powerful than ever.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,22:22,"Behind the counter, as a rule, there were no young men.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,23:23,"The clerks were almost all old boys; but they did not dress as we are accustomed to see old men represented, wearing wigs, nightcaps, and knee-breeches, and with coat and waistcoat buttoned up to the chin.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,24:24,"We have seen the portraits of our great-grandfathers dressed in this way; but the ""pepper gentlemen"" had no money to spare to have their portraits taken, though one of them would have made a very interesting picture for us now, if taken as he appeared standing behind his counter, or going to church, or on holidays.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,25:25,"On these occasions, they wore high-crowned, broad-brimmed hats, and sometimes a younger clerk would stick a feather in his.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,26:26,"The woollen shirt was concealed by a broad, linen collar; the close jacket was buttoned up to the chin, and the cloak hung loosely over it; the trousers were tucked into the broad, tipped shoes, for the clerks wore no stockings.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,27:27,"They generally stuck a table-knife and spoon in their girdles, as well as a larger knife, as a protection to themselves; and such a weapon was often very necessary.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,28:28,"After this fashion was Anthony dressed on holidays and festivals, excepting that, instead of a high-crowned hat, he wore a kind of bonnet, and under it a knitted cap, a regular nightcap, to which he was so accustomed that it was always on his head; he had two, nightcaps I mean, not heads.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,29:29,"Anthony was one of the oldest of the clerks, and just the subject for a painter.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,30:30,"He was as thin as a lath, wrinkled round the mouth and eyes, had long, bony fingers, bushy, gray eyebrows, and over his left eye hung a thick tuft of hair, which did not look handsome, but made his appearance very remarkable.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,31:31,"People knew that he came from Bremen; it was not exactly his home, although his master resided there.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,32:32,"His ancestors were from Thuringia, and had lived in the town of Eisenach, close by Wartburg.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,33:33,"Old Anthony seldom spoke of this place, but he thought of it all the more.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,34:34,"The old clerks of Hauschen Street very seldom met together; each one remained in his own booth, which was closed early enough in the evening, and then it looked dark and dismal out in the street.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,35:35,"Only a faint glimmer of light struggled through the horn panes in the little window on the roof, while within sat the old clerk, generally on his bed, singing his evening hymn in a low voice; or he would be moving about in his booth till late in the night, busily employed in many things.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,36:36,It certainly was not a very lively existence.,N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,37:37,To be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot; no one notices you unless you happen to stand in their way.,N:N,N:S
old_bach.emmood,38:38,"Often, when it was dark night outside, with rain or snow falling, the place looked quite deserted and gloomy.",N:N,N:S
old_bach.emmood,39:39,"There were no lamps in the street, excepting a very small one, which hung at one end of the street, before a picture of the Virgin, which had been painted on the wall.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,40:40,The dashing of the water against the bulwarks of a neighboring castle could plainly be heard.,N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,41:41,"Such evenings are long and dreary, unless people can find something to do; and so Anthony found it.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,42:42,"There were not always things to be packed or unpacked, nor paper bags to be made, nor the scales to be polished.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,43:43,"So Anthony invented employment; he mended his clothes and patched his boots, and when he at last went to bed,- his nightcap, which he had worn from habit, still remained on his head; he had only to pull it down a little farther over his forehead.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,44:44,"Very soon, however, it would be pushed up again to see if the light was properly put out; he would touch it, press the wick together, and at last pull his nightcap over his eyes and lie down again on the other side.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,45:45,But often there would arise in his mind a doubt as to whether every coal had been quite put out in the little fire-pan in the shop below.,N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,46:46,"If even a tiny spark had remained it might set fire to something, and cause great damage.",F:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,47:47,"Then he would rise from his bed, creep down the ladder- for it could scarcely be called a flight of stairs- and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen; so he had just to go back again to bed.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,48:48,"But often, when he had got half way back, he would fancy the iron shutters of the door were not properly fastened, and his thin legs would carry him down again.",F:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,49:49,"And when at last he crept into bed, he would be so cold that his teeth chattered in his head.",N:Sa,N:S
old_bach.emmood,50:50,"He would draw the coverlet closer round him, pull his nightcap over his eyes, and try to turn his thoughts from trade, and from the labors of the day, to olden times.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,51:51,"But this was scarcely an agreeable entertainment; for thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the waking eyes.",Sa:Sa,N:S
old_bach.emmood,52:52,"And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.",Sa:Sa,S:S
old_bach.emmood,53:53,"Sometimes, with a lurid flame, memory would light up a picture of life which had never faded from his heart.",N:N,N:S
old_bach.emmood,54:54,"If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.",Sa:Sa,S:S
old_bach.emmood,55:55,"The pictures did not follow one another in order, as the circumstances they represented had occurred; very often the most painful would come together, and when those came which were most full of joy, they had always the deepest shadow thrown upon them.",Sa:N,S:S
old_bach.emmood,56:56,"The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged by every one to be very beautiful, but more beautiful still in the eyes of old Anthony were the beech woods in the neighborhood of Wartburg.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,57:57,"More grand and venerable to him seemed the old oaks around the proud baronial castle, where the creeping plants hung over the stony summits of the rocks; sweeter was the perfume there of the apple-blossom than in all the land of Denmark.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,58:58,"How vividly were represented to him, in a glittering tear that rolled down his cheek, two children at play- a boy and a girl.",N:Sa,S:S
old_bach.emmood,59:59,"The boy had rosy cheeks, golden ringlets, and clear, blue eyes; he was the son of Anthony, a rich merchant; it was himself.",N:N,N:S
old_bach.emmood,60:60,"The little girl had brown eyes and black hair, and was clever and courageous; she was the mayor's daughter, Molly.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,61:61,"The children were playing with an apple; they shook the apple, and heard the pips rattling in it.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,62:62,"Then they cut it in two, and each of them took half.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,63:63,"They also divided the pips and ate all but one, which the little girl proposed should be placed in the ground.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,64:64,"""You will see what will come out,"" she said; ""something you don't expect.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,65:65,"A whole apple-tree will come out, but not directly.""",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,66:66,"Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon both very busy and eager about it.",H:H,H:H
old_bach.emmood,67:67,"The boy made a hole in the earth with his finger, and the little girl placed the pip in the hole, and then they both covered it over with earth.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,68:68,"""Now you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has taken root,"" said Molly; ""no one ever should do that.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,69:69,"I did so with my flowers, but only twice; I wanted to see if they were growing.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,70:70,"I didn't know any better then, and the flowers all died.""",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,71:71,"Little Anthony kept the flower-pot, and every morning during the whole winter he looked at it, but there was nothing to be seen but black earth.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,72:72,"At last, however, the spring came, and the sun shone warm again, and then two little green leaves sprouted forth in the pot.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,73:73,"""They are Molly and me,"" said the boy.",H:N,H:N

old_bach.emmood,75:75,Very soon a third leaf made its appearance.,N:N,N:H

old_bach.emmood,77:77,"Day after day, and week after week, till the plant became quite a tree.",N:N,N:H
old_bach.emmood,78:78,"And all this about the two children was mirrored to old Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped away and disappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of the old man.",Sa:N,S:S
old_bach.emmood,79:79,"In the neighborhood of Eisenach stretches a ridge of stony mountains, one of which has a rounded outline, and shows itself above the rest without tree, bush, or grass on its barren summits.",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,80:80,"It is called the ""Venus Mountain,"" and the story goes that the ""Lady Venus,"" one of the heathen goddesses, keeps house there.",N:N,N:N

old_bach.emmood,83:83,"Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain, and one day Molly said, ""Do you dare to knock and say, 'Lady Halle, Lady Halle, open the door: Tannhauser is here!'""",N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,84:84,But Anthony did not dare.,N:N,N:N
old_bach.emmood,85:85,"Molly, however, did, though she only said the words, ""Lady Halle, Lady Halle,"" loudly and distinctly; the rest she muttered so much under her breath that Anthony felt certain she had really said nothing; and yet she looked quite bold and saucy, just as she did sometimes when she was in the garden with a number of other little girls; they would all stand round him together, and want to kiss him, because he did not like to be kissed, and pushed them away.",N:N,N:H
old_bach.emmood,86:86,Then Molly was the only one who dared to resist him.,N:N,N:H
old_bach.emmood,87:87,"""I may kiss him,"" she would say proudly, as she threw her arms round his neck; she was vain of her power over Anthony, for he would submit quietly and think nothing of it.",H:N,H:H

ib_and_l.emmood,68:68,And then Ib gave her the second nut.,N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,69:69,The third was a little black thing.,N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,70:70,"""You may keep that one,"" said Christina; ""it is quite as pretty.""",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,71:71,"""What is in it?"" asked Ib.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,72:72,"""The best of all things for you,"" replied the gypsy.",H:N,H:N
ib_and_l.emmood,73:73,So Ib held the nut very tight.,N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,74:74,"Then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path, that they might find their way home: and they went forward certainly in quite another direction to the one they meant to take; therefore no one ought to speak against the woman, and say that she wanted to steal the children.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,75:75,"In the wild wood-path they met a forester who knew Ib, and, by his help, Ib and Christina reached home, where they found every one had been very anxious about them.",H:F,H:F
ib_and_l.emmood,76:76,"They were pardoned and forgiven, although they really had both done wrong, and deserved to get into trouble; first, because they had let the sucking-pig fall into the water; and, secondly, because they had run away.",N:N,H:N
ib_and_l.emmood,77:77,"Christina was taken back to her father's house on the heath, and Ib remained in the farm-house on the borders of the wood, near the great land ridge.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,78:78,"The first thing Ib did that evening was to take out of his pocket the little black nut, in which the best thing of all was said to be enclosed.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,79:79,"He laid it carefully between the door and the door-post, and then shut the door so that the nut cracked directly.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,80:80,"But there was not much kernel to be seen; it was what we should call hollow or worm-eaten, and looked as if it had been filled with tobacco or rich black earth.",Su-:N,-:N
ib_and_l.emmood,81:81,"""It is just what I expected!"" exclaimed Ib.",Su-:N,-:S
ib_and_l.emmood,82:82,"""How should there be room in a little nut like this for the best thing of all?",A:N,A:S
ib_and_l.emmood,83:83,"Christina will find her two nuts just the same; there will be neither fine clothes or a golden carriage in them.""",N:N,N:S
ib_and_l.emmood,84:84,"Winter came; and the new year, and indeed many years passed away; until Ib was old enough to be confirmed, and, therefore, he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the nearest village to be prepared.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,85:85,"One day, about this time, the boatman paid a visit to Ib's parents, and told them that Christina was going to service, and that she had been remarkably fortunate in obtaining a good place, with most respectable people.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,86:86,"""Only think,"" he said, ""She is going to the rich innkeeper's, at the hotel in Herning, many miles west from here.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,87:87,"She is to assist the landlady in the housekeeping; and, if afterwards she behaves well and remains to be confirmed, the people will treat her as their own daughter.""",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,88:88,So Ib and Christina took leave of each other.,N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,89:89,"People already called them ""the betrothed,"" and at parting the girl showed Ib the two nuts, which she had taken care of ever since the time that they lost themselves in the wood; and she told him also that the little wooden shoes he once carved for her when he was a boy, and gave her as a present, had been carefully kept in a drawer ever since.",N:N,N:H
ib_and_l.emmood,90:90,And so they parted.,N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,91:91,"After Ib's confirmation, he remained at home with his mother, for he had become a clever shoemaker, and in summer managed the farm for her quite alone.",N:N,N:H
ib_and_l.emmood,92:92,"His father had been dead some time, and his mother kept no farm servants.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,93:93,"Sometimes, but very seldom, he heard of Christina, through a postillion or eel-seller who was passing.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,94:94,"But she was well off with the rich innkeeper; and after being confirmed she wrote a letter to her father, in which was a kind message to Ib and his mother.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,95:95,"In this letter, she mentioned that her master and mistress had made her a present of a beautiful new dress, and some nice under-clothes.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,96:96,"This was, of course, pleasant news.",N:N,N:H
ib_and_l.emmood,97:97,"One day, in the following spring, there came a knock at the door of the house where Ib's old mother lived; and when they opened it, lo and behold, in stepped the boatman and Christina.",Su+:N,+:H
ib_and_l.emmood,98:98,"She had come to pay them a visit, and to spend the day.",N:N,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,99:99,"A carriage had to come from the Herning hotel to the next village, and she had taken the opportunity to see her friends once more.",N:N,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,100:100,"She looked as elegant as a real lady, and wore a pretty dress, beautifully made on purpose for her.",N:N,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,101:101,"There she stood, in full dress, while Ib wore only his working clothes.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,102:102,"He could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open his lips.",H:H,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,103:103,"Christina, however, was quite at her ease; she talked and talked, and kissed him in the most friendly manner.",H:N,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,104:104,"Even afterwards, when they were left alone, and she asked, ""Did you know me again, Ib?"" he still stood holding her hand, and said at last, ""You are become quite a grand lady, Christina, and I am only a rough working man; but I have often thought of you and of old times.""",H:N,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,105:105,"Then they wandered up the great ridge, and looked across the stream to the heath, where the little hills were covered with the flowering broom.",N:N,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,106:106,"Ib said nothing; but before the time came for them to part, it became quite clear to him that Christina must be his wife: had they not even in childhood been called the betrothed?",N:N,N:H
ib_and_l.emmood,107:107,"To him it seemed as if they were really engaged to each other, although not a word had been spoken on the subject.",N:N,N:H
ib_and_l.emmood,108:108,"They had only a few more hours to remain together, for Christina was obliged to return that evening to the neighboring village, to be ready for the carriage which was to start the next morning early for Herning.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,109:109,Ib and her father accompanied her to the village.,N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,110:110,"It was a fine moonlight evening; and when they arrived, Ib stood holding Christina's hand in his, as if he could not let her go.",N:N,N:H
ib_and_l.emmood,111:111,"His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: ""Christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be married some day.",H:H,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,112:112,"But we can wait for a while.""",N:N,N:H
ib_and_l.emmood,113:113,"""Oh yes,"" she replied; ""Let us wait a little longer, Ib.",H:N,H:N
ib_and_l.emmood,114:114,"I can trust you, for I believe that I do love you.",H:H,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,115:115,"But let me think it over.""",Su-:N,-:N
ib_and_l.emmood,116:116,Then he kissed her lips; and so they parted.,H:N,H:H
ib_and_l.emmood,117:117,"On the way home, Ib told the boatman that he and Christina were as good as engaged to each other; and the boatman found out that he had always expected it would be so, and went home with Ib that evening, and remained the night in the farmhouse; but nothing further was said of the engagement.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,118:118,"During the next year, two letters passed between Ib and Christina.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,119:119,"They were signed, ""Faithful till death;"" but at the end of that time, one day the boatman came over to see Ib, with a kind greeting from Christina.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,120:120,"He had something else to say, which made him hesitate in a strange manner.",N:F,N:F
ib_and_l.emmood,121:121,"At last it came out that Christina, who had grown a very pretty girl, was more lucky than ever.",N:N,N:H
ib_and_l.emmood,122:122,"She was courted and admired by every one; but her master's son, who had been home on a visit, was so much pleased with Christina that he wished to marry her.",Su-:H,-:H
ib_and_l.emmood,123:123,"He had a very good situation in an office at Copenhagen, and as she had also taken a liking for him, his parents were not unwilling to consent.",N:N,N:H
ib_and_l.emmood,124:124,"But Christina, in her heart, often thought of Ib, and knew how much he thought of her; so she felt inclined to refuse this good fortune, added the boatman.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,125:125,"At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- ""Christina must not refuse this good fortune.""",Sa:Sa,S:S

ib_and_l.emmood,128:128,"The words were not what he wished to say, so he tore up the page.",N:N,S:S
ib_and_l.emmood,129:129,"The following morning, however, a letter lay ready to be sent to Christina, and the following is what he wrote:- ""The letter written by you to your father I have read, and see from it that you are prosperous in everything, and that still better fortune is in store for you.",N:N,S:S
ib_and_l.emmood,130:130,"Ask your own heart, Christina, and think over carefully what awaits you if you take me for your husband, for I possess very little in the world.",N:N,S:S

ib_and_l.emmood,141:141,"Thinking as he did of old times, no wonder the three nuts came into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him when a child, and of the two which he had given to Christina.",N:N,N:N

ib_and_l.emmood,147:147,"Perhaps it was, and this also would be fulfilled.",N:N,N:N

ib_and_l.emmood,156:156,"Years passed; and for many summers the heath was covered with bloom; in winter the snow rested upon it, and the rough winds blew across the ridge under which stood Ib's sheltered home.",N:N,N:N
ib_and_l.emmood,157:157,"One spring day the sun shone brightly, and he was guiding the plough across his field.",N:N,N:N

goloshes.emmood,291:291,"Then he entered the heart of this man's wife; it was an old, tumble-down pigeon-house; the husband's portrait served as a weather-cock; it was connected with all the doors, which opened and shut just as the husband's decision turned.",N:N,N:N

goloshes.emmood,340:340,"The difference is this, the poet's intellectual memory is better; he seizes upon an idea or a sentiment, until he can embody it, clearly and plainly in words, which the others cannot do.",N:N,N:N
goloshes.emmood,341:341,But the transition from a character of every-day life to one of a more gifted nature is a great transition; and so the clerk became aware of the change after a time.,N:N,N:N

nighting.emmood,35:35,"Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the scraps from the table; she lives down by the sea-shore, and as I come back I feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, and listen to the nightingale's song.",N:N,N:S

nighting.emmood,55:55,"""My song sounds best in the green wood,"" said the bird; but still she came willingly when she heard the emperor's wish.",N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,56:56,The palace was elegantly decorated for the occasion.,N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,57:57,The walls and floors of porcelain glittered in the light of a thousand lamps.,N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,58:58,"Beautiful flowers, round which little bells were tied, stood in the corridors: what with the running to and fro and the draught, these bells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to be heard.",N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,59:59,"In the centre of the great hall, a golden perch had been fixed for the nightingale to sit on.",N:N,N:H

nighting.emmood,62:62,"All were in full dress, and every eye was turned to the little gray bird when the emperor nodded to her to begin.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,63:63,"The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.",H:H,H:H
nighting.emmood,64:64,"The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already.",H:H,H:H
nighting.emmood,65:65,"""I have seen tears in an emperor's eyes,"" she said, ""that is my richest reward.",H:N,H:H
nighting.emmood,66:66,"An emperor's tears have wonderful power, and are quite sufficient honor for me;"" and then she sang again more enchantingly than ever.",H:N,H:H
nighting.emmood,67:67,"""That singing is a lovely gift;"" said the ladies of the court to each other; and then they took water in their mouths to make them utter the gurgling sounds of the nightingale when they spoke to any one, so thay they might fancy themselves nightingales.",H:N,H:N
nighting.emmood,68:68,"And the footmen and chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction, which is saying a great deal, for they are very difficult to please.",N:H,H:H
nighting.emmood,69:69,In fact the nightingale's visit was most successful.,N:N,H:H
nighting.emmood,70:70,"She was now to remain at court, to have her own cage, with liberty to go out twice a day, and once during the night.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,71:71,"Twelve servants were appointed to attend her on these occasions, who each held her by a silken string fastened to her leg.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,72:72,There was certainly not much pleasure in this kind of flying.,N:Sa,N:S
nighting.emmood,73:73,"The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two people met, one said ""nightin,"" and the other said ""gale,"" and they understood what was meant, for nothing else was talked of.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,74:74,"Eleven peddlers' children were named after her, but not of them could sing a note.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,75:75,"One day the emperor received a large packet on which was written ""The Nightingale.""",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,76:76,"""Here is no doubt a new book about our celebrated bird,"" said the emperor.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,77:77,"But instead of a book, it was a work of art contained in a casket, an artificial nightingale made to look like a living one, and covered all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,78:78,"As soon as the artificial bird was wound up, it could sing like the real one, and could move its tail up and down, which sparkled with silver and gold.",N:N,N:N

nighting.emmood,81:81,"""Now they must sing together,"" said the court, ""and what a duet it will be.""",H:N,H:H
nighting.emmood,82:82,"But they did not get on well, for the real nightingale sang in its own natural way, but the artificial bird sang only waltzes.",N:Sa,N:S
nighting.emmood,83:83,"""That is not a fault,"" said the music-master, ""it is quite perfect to my taste,"" so then it had to sing alone, and was as successful as the real bird; besides, it was so much prettier to look at, for it sparkled like bracelets and breast-pins.",N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,84:84,"Three and thirty times did it sing the same tunes without being tired; the people would gladly have heard it again, but the emperor said the living nightingale ought to sing something.",N:H,N:H
nighting.emmood,85:85,But where was she?,N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,86:86,"No one had noticed her when she flew out at the open window, back to her own green woods.",N:N,N:-
nighting.emmood,87:87,"""What strange conduct,"" said the emperor, when her flight had been discovered; and all the courtiers blamed her, and said she was a very ungrateful creature.",Su-:A,-:A
nighting.emmood,88:88,"""But we have the best bird after all,"" said one, and then they would have the bird sing again, although it was the thirty-fourth time they had listened to the same piece, and even then they had not learnt it, for it was rather difficult.",N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,89:89,"But the music-master praised the bird in the highest degree, and even asserted that it was better than a real nightingale, not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds, but also in its musical power.",H:N,H:H
nighting.emmood,90:90,"""For you must perceive, my chief lord and emperor, that with a real nightingale we can never tell what is going to be sung, but with this bird everything is settled.",N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,91:91,"It can be opened and explained, so that people may understand how the waltzes are formed, and why one note follows upon another.""",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,92:92,"""This is exactly what we think,"" they all replied, and then the music-master received permission to exhibit the bird to the people on the following Sunday, and the emperor commanded that they should be present to hear it sing.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,93:93,"When they heard it they were like people intoxicated; however it must have been with drinking tea, which is quite a Chinese custom.",N:H,N:H
nighting.emmood,94:94,"They all said ""Oh!"" and held up their forefingers and nodded, but a poor fisherman, who had heard the real nightingale, said, ""it sounds prettily enough, and the melodies are all alike; yet there seems something wanting, I cannot exactly tell what.""",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,95:95,"And after this the real nightingale was banished from the empire, and the artificial bird placed on a silk cushion close to the emperor's bed.",Su-:N,-:N
nighting.emmood,96:96,"The presents of gold and precious stones which had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now advanced to the title of ""Little Imperial Toilet Singer,"" and to the rank of No. 1 on the left hand; for the emperor considered the left side, on which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor is in the same place as that of other people.",N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,97:97,"The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five volumes, about the artificial bird, which was very learned and very long, and full of the most difficult Chinese words; yet all the people said they had read it, and understood it, for fear of being thought stupid and having their bodies trampled upon.",F:F,N:F
nighting.emmood,98:98,"So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; and for that same reason it pleased them better.",H:H,H:H
nighting.emmood,99:99,"They could sing with the bird, which they often did.",N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,100:100,"The street-boys sang, ""Zi-zi-zi, cluck, cluck, cluck,"" and the emperor himself could sing it also.",N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,101:101,It was really most amusing.,N:N,N:H
nighting.emmood,102:102,"One evening, when the artificial bird was singing its best, and the emperor lay in bed listening to it, something inside the bird sounded ""whizz.""",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,103:103,Then a spring cracked.,Su-:N,-:-

nighting.emmood,105:105,"The emperor immediately sprang out of bed, and called for his physician; but what could he do?",Su-:N,-:-
nighting.emmood,106:106,"Then they sent for a watchmaker; and, after a great deal of talking and examination, the bird was put into something like order; but he said that it must be used very carefully, as the barrels were worn, and it would be impossible to put in new ones without injuring the music.",N:N,N:S
nighting.emmood,107:107,"Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.",Sa:Sa,S:S
nighting.emmood,108:108,"Then the music-master made a little speech, full of hard words, and declared that the bird was as good as ever; and, of course no one contradicted him.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,109:109,"Five years passed, and then a real grief came upon the land.",N:Sa,N:S
nighting.emmood,110:110,"The Chinese really were fond of their emperor, and he now lay so ill that he was not expected to live.",Sa:N,S:S
nighting.emmood,111:111,"Already a new emperor had been chosen and the people who stood in the street asked the lord-in-waiting how the old emperor was; but he only said, ""Pooh!"" and shook his head.",D:N,D:S
nighting.emmood,112:112,"Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor.",Sa:Sa,S:S
nighting.emmood,113:113,"The chamberlains went out to have a talk on the matter, and the ladies'-maids invited company to take coffee.",N:N,N:N
nighting.emmood,114:114,"Cloth had been laid down on the halls and passages, so that not a footstep should be heard, and all was silent and still.",N:N,N:N

nighting.emmood,139:139,"She sung of the quiet churchyard, where the white roses grow, where the elder-tree wafts its perfume on the breeze, and the fresh, sweet grass is moistened by the mourners' tears.",N:N,H:H

90_the_young_giant.emmood,28:28,"When he had done it, he went into the forest, and pulled up two oak-trees, laid them across his shoulders, and hung on them one harrow behind and one before, and also one horse behind and one before, and carried all as if it had been a bundle of straw, to his parents"" house.",N:N,N:+

90_the_young_giant.emmood,42:42,"The farmer was glad, put his two horses in his cart, and fetched from the smith a staff so large and thick, that the two horses could only just bring it away.",H:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,43:43,"The youth laid it across his knees, and snap! he broke it in two in the middle like a bean-stalk, and threw it away.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,44:44,"The father then harnessed four horses, and brought a bar which was so long and thick, that the four horses could only just drag it.",N:N,N:N

90_the_young_giant.emmood,71:71,"At length he arose from the feathers, but first he got himself two bushels of peas from the loft, made himself some broth with them, ate it at his leisure, and when that was done, went and harnessed the horses, and drove into the wood.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,72:72,"Not far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass, so he first drove the horses on, and then stopped them, and went behind the cart, took trees and brushwood, and made a great barricade, so that no horse could get through.",N:N,N:N

90_the_young_giant.emmood,78:78,"When he was over, he said to the others, ""There, you see, I have got over quicker than you,"" and drove on, and the others had to stay where they were.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,79:79,"In the yard, however, he took a tree in his hand, showed it to the bailiff, and said, ""Isn""t that a fine bundle of wood?""",N:N,N:+

90_the_young_giant.emmood,82:82,"The bailiff, however, was afraid of the blows which he was to receive, and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having them; for rather than that, he himself would be head-servant, and the youth should be bailiff.",F:F,F:N

90_the_young_giant.emmood,88:88,"The clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said that no one was sure of his life with the head-servant, for he could kill a man as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get into the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would roll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on his head; and then he would never return to daylight.",N:N,N:N

bottle_n.emmood,99:99,"It had returned home, and the language was as a welcome greeting.",H:N,H:H
bottle_n.emmood,100:100,"For very joy, it felt ready to jump out of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten.",H:H,H:H

bottle_n.emmood,107:107,"The stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.",H:N,H:N

bottle_n.emmood,110:110,"Everything here appeared lovely to our bottle, for it was again in the green wood, amid joy and feasting; again it heard music and song, and the noise and murmur of a crowd, especially in that part of the garden where the lamps blazed, and the paper lanterns displayed their brilliant colors.",H:N,H:H
bottle_n.emmood,111:111,"It stood in a distant walk certainly, but a place pleasant for contemplation; and it carried a light; and was at once useful and ornamental.",H:N,H:H

bottle_n.emmood,121:121,"A great crowd assembled to witness the sight; military music had been engaged, and many other preparations made.",N:N,N:N
bottle_n.emmood,122:122,The bottle saw it all from the basket in which he lay close to a live rabbit.,N:N,N:N

bottle_n.emmood,125:125,"Then the ropes which held it were cut through, and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit, while the music sounded and all the people shouted ""Hurrah.""",H:N,H:H
bottle_n.emmood,126:126,"""This is a wonderful journey up into the air,"" thought the bottle; ""it is a new way of sailing, and here, at least, there is no fear of striking against anything.""",H:N,H:H
bottle_n.emmood,127:127,"Thousands of people gazed at the balloon, and the old maid who was in the garden saw it also; for she stood at the open window of the garret, by which hung the cage containing the linnet, who then had no water-glass, but was obliged to be contented with an old cup.",N:N,N:N
bottle_n.emmood,128:128,"In the window-sill stood a myrtle in a pot, and this had been pushed a little on one side, that it might not fall out; for the old maid was leaning out of the window, that she might see.",N:N,N:N
bottle_n.emmood,129:129,"And she did see distinctly the aeronaut in the balloon, and how he let down the rabbit in the parachute, and then drank to the health of all the spectators in the wine from the bottle.",N:N,N:N
bottle_n.emmood,130:130,"After doing this, he hurled it high into the air.",N:N,N:-
bottle_n.emmood,131:131,"How little she thought that this was the very same bottle which her friend had thrown aloft in her honor, on that happy day of rejoicing, in the green wood, in her youthful days.",N:N,N:-
bottle_n.emmood,132:132,"The bottle had no time to think, when raised so suddenly; and before it was aware, it reached the highest point it had ever attained in its life.",N:N,N:-
bottle_n.emmood,133:133,"Steeples and roofs lay far, far beneath it, and the people looked as tiny as possible.",N:N,+:-
bottle_n.emmood,134:134,"Then it began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done, made somersaults in the air, and felt itself quite young and unfettered, although it was half full of wine.",Su+:N,+:-
bottle_n.emmood,135:135,But this did not last long.,N:N,N:-
bottle_n.emmood,136:136,What a journey it was!,N:N,+:-
bottle_n.emmood,137:137,All the people could see the bottle; for the sun shone upon it.,N:N,N:-
bottle_n.emmood,138:138,"The balloon was already far away, and very soon the bottle was far away also; for it fell upon a roof, and broke in pieces.",N:N,N:-
bottle_n.emmood,139:139,"But the pieces had got such an impetus in them, that they could not stop themselves.",N:N,N:-
bottle_n.emmood,140:140,"They went jumping and rolling about, till at last they fell into the court-yard, and were broken into still smaller pieces; only the neck of the bottle managed to keep whole, and it was broken off as clean as if it had been cut with a diamond.",N:N,N:-
bottle_n.emmood,141:141,"""That would make a capital bird's glass,"" said one of the cellar-men; but none of them had either a bird or a cage, and it was not to be expected they would provide one just because they had found a bottle neck that could be used as a glass.",N:N,N:-
bottle_n.emmood,142:142,"But the old maid who lived in the garret had a bird, and it really might be useful to her; so the bottle neck was provided with a cork, and taken up to her; and, as it often happens in life, the part that had been uppermost was now turned downwards, and it was filled with fresh water.",N:N,N:N
bottle_n.emmood,143:143,"Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered more merrily than ever.",H:H,H:H
bottle_n.emmood,144:144,"""Ah, you have good reason to sing,"" said the bottle neck, which was looked upon as something very remarkable, because it had been in a balloon; nothing further was known of its history.",N:N,N:N
bottle_n.emmood,145:145,"As it hung there in the bird's-cage, it could hear the noise and murmur of the people in the street below, as well as the conversation of the old maid in the room within.",N:N,N:N
bottle_n.emmood,146:146,"An old friend had just come to visit her, and they talked, not about the bottle neck, but of the myrtle in the window.",N:N,N:N
bottle_n.emmood,147:147,"""No, you must not spend a dollar for your daughter's bridal bouquet,"" said the old maid; ""you shall have a beautiful little bunch for a nosegay, full of blossoms.",N:N,N:N

bottle_n.emmood,152:152,"There were tears in the eyes of the old maid, as she spoke of the beloved of her youth, and of their betrothal in the wood.",H:Sa,H:S
bottle_n.emmood,153:153,"Many thoughts came into her mind; but the thought never came, that quite close to her, in that very window, was a remembrance of those olden times,- the neck of the bottle which had, as it were shouted for joy when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day.",N:N,H:N
bottle_n.emmood,154:154,"But the bottle neck did not recognize the old maid; he had not been listening to what she had related, perhaps because he was thinking so much about her.",N:N,N:N

tinderbx.emmood,11:11,"But you need not be at all afraid of him; I will give you my blue checked apron, which you must spread upon the floor, and then boldly seize hold of the dog, and place him upon it.",N:N,N:N

tinderbx.emmood,28:28,"Then he closed the lid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into another chamber, And, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.",N:N,N:N
tinderbx.emmood,29:29,"""You had better not look at me in that way,"" said the soldier; ""you will make your eyes water;"" and then he seated him also upon the apron, and opened the chest.",N:N,N:N

tinderbx.emmood,31:31,"Then he went into the third room, and there the dog was really hideous; his eyes were, truly, as big as towers, and they turned round and round in his head like wheels.",N:N,N:N
tinderbx.emmood,32:32,"""Good morning,"" said the soldier, touching his cap, for he had never seen such a dog in his life.",N:N,N:-
tinderbx.emmood,33:33,"But after looking at him more closely, he thought he had been civil enough, so he placed him on the floor, and opened the chest.",N:N,N:N
tinderbx.emmood,34:34,"Good gracious, what a quantity of gold there was! enough to buy all the sugar-sticks of the sweet-stuff women; all the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horses in the world, or even the whole town itself There was, indeed, an immense quantity.",Su+:N,+:+
tinderbx.emmood,35:35,"So the soldier now threw away all the silver money he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with gold instead; and not only his pockets and his knapsack, but even his cap and boots, so that he could scarcely walk.",N:N,H:H

tinderbx.emmood,53:53,"However, he passed a very pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling.",H:H,H:H

li_claus.emmood,18:18,"Presently a storm arose, and he lost his way, and before he discovered the right path, evening came on, and it was still a long way to the town, and too far to return home before night.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,19:19,Near the road stood a large farmhouse.,N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,20:20,"The shutters outside the windows were closed, but lights shone through the crevices at the top.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,21:21,"""I might get permission to stay here for the night,"" thought Little Claus; so he went up to the door and knocked.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,22:22,"The farmer's wife opened the door; but when she heard what he wanted, she told him to go away, as her husband would not allow her to admit strangers.",N:N,N:N

li_claus.emmood,26:26,"So Little Claus climbed to the roof of the shed, and while he turned himself to get comfortable, he discovered that the wooden shutters, which were closed, did not reach to the tops of the windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see into a room, in which a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and a splendid fish.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,27:27,"The farmer's wife and the sexton were sitting at the table together; and she filled his glass, and helped him plenteously to fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish.",H:N,H:N

li_claus.emmood,29:29,"At this moment he heard some one riding down the road, towards the farmhouse.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,30:30,It was the farmer returning home.,N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,31:31,"He was a good man, but still he had a very strange prejudice,- he could not bear the sight of a sexton.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,32:32,"If one appeared before him, he would put himself in a terrible rage.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,33:33,"In consequence of this dislike, the sexton had gone to visit the farmer's wife during her husband's absence from home, and the good woman had placed before him the best she had in the house to eat.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,34:34,"When she heard the farmer coming she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room.",F:F,F:F
li_claus.emmood,35:35,"He did so, for he knew her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton.",F:N,F:F
li_claus.emmood,36:36,"The woman then quickly put away the wine, and hid all the rest of the nice things in the oven; for if her husband had seen them he would have asked what they were brought out for.",F:N,F:F
li_claus.emmood,37:37,"""Oh, dear,"" sighed Little Claus from the top of the shed, as he saw all the good things disappear.",Sa:N,N:S

li_claus.emmood,40:40,"Come down, and come into the house with me.""",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,41:41,So Little Claus came down and told the farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a night's lodging.,N:N,N:N

li_claus.emmood,49:49,"""Oh, it is a conjuror,"" said Little Claus; ""and he says we need not eat porridge, for he has conjured the oven full of roast meat, fish, and pie.""",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,50:50,"""Wonderful!"" cried the farmer, starting up and opening the oven door; and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer's wife, but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under the table.",Su+:N,+:H
li_claus.emmood,51:51,"The woman dared not say anything; so she placed the things before them, and they both ate of the fish, the meat, and the pastry.",F:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,52:52,"Then Little Claus trod again upon his sack, and it squeaked as before.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,53:53,"""What does he say now?"" asked the farmer.",N:N,N:N
li_claus.emmood,54:54,"""He says,"" replied Little Claus, ""that there are three bottles of wine for us, standing in the corner, by the oven.""",N:N,N:N
